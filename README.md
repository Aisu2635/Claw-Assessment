Azure Cloud deployment
# Name: Om Rajesh Hinge

> Scenario:
You are a cloud infrastructure engineer responsible for deploying and managing Azure virtual machines for a web application. The application requires multiple VMs to support its frontend, backend, and database components.

Task Details:

1. Virtual Machine Deployment:

*Objective*: Deploy Azure virtual machines to host components of the web application.
```
Tasks:
Create three virtual machines:
One VM for the frontend application server (e.g., running a Node.js or ASP.NET application).
One VM for the backend application server (e.g., running a RESTful API or web server).
One VM for the database server (e.g., running SQL Server or MySQL).
Choose appropriate VM sizes based on workload requirements (e.g., compute, memory, storage).
Configure availability options such as availability sets or availability zones for high availability.
Set up virtual machine extensions for monitoring and management (e.g., Azure Diagnostics Extension).
```
2. Networking and Security Configuration:

*Objective*: Configure networking settings and implement security measures for Azure virtual machines.
```
Tasks:
Create a virtual network (VNet) and define subnets for each VM tier (frontend, backend, database).
Configure network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to VMs.
Implement network security rules to allow specific protocols and ports for communication.
Configure private and public IP addresses for VMs based on their accessibility requirements.
Implement network security best practices such as Network Watcher for monitoring and NSG flow logs for logging.
```
3. VM Management and Optimization:

*Objective*: Manage and optimize Azure virtual machines for performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.
```
Tasks:
Install and configure necessary software and dependencies on each VM according to their roles.
Implement Azure Backup to enable regular backups of VM disks.
Monitor VM performance metrics using Azure Monitor and set up alerts for critical thresholds.
Optimize VM resources by resizing VMs based on performance metrics and workload demands.
Implement Azure Reserved Instances (RIs) or Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) for cost optimization if applicable.
```
